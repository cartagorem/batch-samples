# Batch Samples

This repo was copied from [batch-samples](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/batch-samples/).
It's meaning to follow the [batch quickstart guide](https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/create-run-example-job).

Note: while google cloud quickstart guides are not allowing merging from issues, this repo will collect some issues and adapt to my specific needings.
